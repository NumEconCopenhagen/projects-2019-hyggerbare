# Dataproject

In this data project we analyze the evolution of US GDP and its four subcomponents covering the period from 2005 to 2017, extracting data from the FRED database. First, we describe the data using empirical moments. Moving on, we plot the raw time series in the same diagram to illustrate the upward trend. The interactive menu is used to inspect the series separately. Bar charts are constructed to illustrate the individual size differences of the four major demand components at three different selected points in time. Lastly, we transform the raw time series and plot the quarterly growth rates of total GDP and the four components to illustrate presence of business cycles and their cyclical nature.

The notebook is organized as follows:
  1. Importing and organizing data
  2. Descriptive analysis
  3. Graphical analysis
