# Exam portfolio by hyggerbare

This repository contains four files. Three self-contained Jupyter notebooks: examproject, dataProject, and modelproject. Furthermore, a list of feedbacks given by the group members. 

The examproject-notebook consists of three problems:
* Human capital and labor supply
* Simulation of the AS-AD model
* Exchange economy

The dataProject-notebook present data regarding the US economy covering the period from 2005 to 2017 with focus on aggregate macroeconomic data.

The modelproject solves the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmann model analytically and numerically, and presents a forward shooting algorithm to find initial bundles that will converge to steady state. 

No non-standard packages are used in the notebooks.
