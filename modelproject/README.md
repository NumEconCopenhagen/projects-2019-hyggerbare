# Modelproject

The model project consists of a self-contained Jupyter notebook, Ramsey.ipynb.

The Ramsey is a long-run economic growth model. We solve it both analytically and numerically. Furthermore, we implement a forward-shooting algorithm which yields the unique inital consumption for a given level of capital per capita ensuring convergence to the steady state. 

The notebook runs using only the packages imported in the first cell.
